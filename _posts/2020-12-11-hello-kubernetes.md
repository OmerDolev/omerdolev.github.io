Kubernetes is a very big subject. I know people that have been working with it for years, and still dont have a good grasp on what's going on in certain parts.
Here I will try to illustrate what Kubernetes is and what is it's objective as I see it. I will delve into different concepts as we continue on.

## What is Kubernetes?

To find an answer to that question you can visit Kubernetes docs, but if you are already here then, Kubernetes is summed up most of the times as a container orchestrator.
When you look at it pragmatically it's what most of the job of Kubernetes is, running containers. But in reality it's much much more than that.

There are many different factors embedded in the notion of running containers, and Kubernetes let's you control that if you like. Making things flexible when needed but it also
enables automation.
