## What's All That Cloud Buzz?!

One of the reasons so many new start-ups can try to make our life easier is "THE CLOUD".

Let's say you have an apartment, you have your living room, bedroom, bath room, kitchen and accessories. 
Suddenly, you get a deal from your work place, a 3 months vacation (a place eveyone would like to work at) to the caribbeans. During these 3 months, even if you are not effectively using your apartment, you still have to pay rent and additional bills and fees.  
In that case, what many would do is subletting their apartment, which means that they can make some money during their vacation and cover the expenses for their apartment.

Let's get a bit more technical, let's imagine the same flow but with computers.  
Say you have a computer that for an irrelevant reason would have to stay inactive unless you somehow let people run workloads on that computer while it's not used. You might even get some profit out of it, since running a computer is not that expensive.

This is basically (very basically) what cloud is.  
There are companies (huge companies) that have a vast amount of compute resources. Those companies need lots of resources to run their services and still they have so much more, that they lend those compute resources to other companies to run their services.

Another thing that made cloud approachable is the simplicity. All you need to do is just create an account, make sure there is a payment method and you can use the cloud provider resources (provider is the company that lends its resources to other companies).

The billing model is also quite simple. The general concept is "pay for what you use", which basically mean you pay for the usage per a certain amount of time.
